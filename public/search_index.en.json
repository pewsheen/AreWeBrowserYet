They can be used on all pages.\n\nAlerts\nGitHub-style alerts. Simply wrap the text of desired alert inside the shortcode to get the desired look.\nAvailable alert types:\n\nnote: Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.\ntip: Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.\nimportant: Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.\nwarning: Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.\ncaution: Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNote\n\tUseful information that users should know, even when skimming content.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTip\n\tHelpful advice for doing things better or more easily.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tImportant\n\tKey information users need to know to achieve their goal.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWarning\n\tUrgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCaution\n\tAdvises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.\n\n\n\nImages and Videos\nBy default images and videos come with some generic styling, such as rounded corners and shadow. To fine-tune these, you can use shortcodes with different variable combinations.\nAvailable variables are:\n\nurl: URL to an image.\nurl_min: URL to compressed version of an image, original can be opened by clicking on the image.\nalt: Alt text, same as if the text were inside square brackets in Markdown.\nfull: Forces image to be full-width.\nfull_bleed: Forces image to fill all the available screen width. Removes shadow, rounded corners and zoom on hover.\nstart: Float image to the start of paragraph and scale it down.\nend: Float image to the end of paragraph and scale it down.\npixels: Uses nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.\ntransparent: Removes rounded corners and shadow, useful for images with transparency.\nno_hover: Removes zoom on hover.\nspoiler: Blurs image until hovered over/pressed on, useful for plot rich game screenshots.\nspoiler with solid: Ditto, but makes the image completely hidden.\n\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\nImage with compressed version, an alt text, and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text, hidden behind a spoiler\n\nAlternatively, you can append the following URL anchors. It can be more handy in some cases, e.g. such images will render normally in any Markdown editor, opposed to the Zola shortcodes.\n\n#full: Forces image to be full-width.\n#full-bleed: Forces image to fill all the available screen width.

Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.\nAs with the earlier reed pen (and later dip pen), a quill has no internal ink reservoir and therefore needs to periodically be dipped into an inkwell during writing. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool anymore because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and would quickly wear a quill down. However it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who have noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.\n\nKeyboard Input (&lt;kbd&gt;)\n\nTo switch the keyboard layout, press ⌘ Super + Space.\n\nMark Text (&lt;mark&gt;)\n\nYou know what?

Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.\nSomething was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.\nBut as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.\nAll of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/long-long-man/","title":"Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Man","description":null,"body":"\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.
